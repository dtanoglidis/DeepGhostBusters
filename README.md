### Abstract 
Wide-field astronomical surveys are often plagued by the presence of reflected (often known as "ghosting artifacts" or, simply, "ghosts") and scattered-light artifacts. 
The identification and mitigation of these artifacts is crucial for rigorous astronomical analyses. 
However, the identification of ghosts and scattered-light artifacts is challenging given the complex morphology of these features and the large data volume of current and near-future surveys. 
In this work we use images from the Dark Energy Survey to train, validate, and test a Mask R-CNN model to detect and localize ghosts and scattered-light artifacts. 
We find that the ability of the Mask R-CNN model to mask affected regions is superior to that of conventional algorithms and classical CNN methods. 
We propose that a multi-step pipeline combining Mask R-CNN segmentation with a classical CNN classifier provides a powerful technique for the automated detection of ghosting and scattered-light artifacts in current and near-future surveys.

### Mask R-CNN implementation

</p>

[Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) is a state-of-the art instance segmentation algorithm developed by Facebook's AI Research team ([FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com/)).

In this work we use the Mask R-CNN implementation developed by [Matterport](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow.

Training the Mask R-CNN algorithm requires a number of images and and ground truth segmentation masks identifying objects of interest in each image.

We use 2000,  400x400 pixel, ghost- and scattered-light-containing focal plane images, coming from the full six years of operations of the Dark Energy Survey ([DES](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/)). 
These come from the training set used in [Chang et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10524) to train a standard CNN to distinguish clean from ghost-containing images, and are publicly available [here](https://des.ncsa.illinois.edu/releases/other/paper-data).

The masks were manually generated by eight of the authors of the present work, using the VGG Image Annotator ([VGG](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/)). The annotatios are provided as `json` files containing, for each image, the coordinates of the manually created masks. 
An example of an artifact-containing image (left) with the corresponding masks (right) is shown above.

Before training, we randomly split the full dataset (images and corresponding masks) into a training set (1400 images), a validation set (300 images), and a test set (300 images), as shown in the notebook [dataset_split.ipynb](/Datasets/Dataset_Split.ipynb)
